# GravitySimulator3D
GravitySimulator3D allows you to simulate (anti) gravity on 3D objects by editing scene files

It all starts with:

MainStage -> LoadScene (extends SuperScene) -> Node3D (MyCam, MySphere, MyThis, MyThat, bla, bla).

Don't forget to read up on the JavaFX 8 3D chapter.
Now that you're up to speed with it, good luck ;-)
